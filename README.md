# Image-Quality-Assessment-Benchmark
A list of state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms collected by [Wei Zhou](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~weichou). If you find that important resources are not included, please feel free to contact me.

According to the availability of the whole or partial original undistorted image (often called reference image), image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms are typically divided into three categories as follows: 1) full-reference IQA (FR-IQA), 2) reduced-reference IQA (RR-IQA), and 3) no-reference IQA (NR-IQA).

**FR-IQA**
